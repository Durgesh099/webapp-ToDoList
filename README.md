<p align="left">#  Introduction<br><br>The ToDoList app utilizes the ReactJS library exclusively to construct a range of components that seamlessly interact.<br><br>Operating as a Single Page Application, the navigation bar remains fixed at the top, while the Tasks and Information Page are displayed below it. Users can seamlessly add, modify, and remove tasks, but it's worth noting that task data is not retained as the app currently lacks a connection to a server or backend. However, it's designed with the potential for future integration with a server to store user-specific tasks. The app is user-friendly and includes an informative page within the app for easy reference.</p>
